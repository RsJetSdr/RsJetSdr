Module "UART_Control" (component Init_UART_VAR0)
   - UART_Control_Init -This method initializes registers of the UART module according to the Peripheral Initialization 
                settings. Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE 
                automatically; see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "DMAT1"     (component DMATransfer_LDD)
   - DMAT1_Init -Initializes the DMATransfer component. Allocates memory for the device data structure.  This method can be 
                called only once. Before the second call of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - DMAT1_Deinit -Deinitializes the DMATransfer component.
   - DMAT1_AllocateChannel -The method allocates DMA channel for the DMA transfer. This method must be called before DMA 
                channel is initialized. Otherwise ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned after call of DMA_LDD channel methods.
   - DMAT1_EnableChannel -The method initializes and/or enables the DMA channel allocated for the DMA transfer defined by the 
                transfer descriptor input parameter DescriptorPtr. First call of this method on given DMA channel initializes 
                it and enables HW requests if Peripheral device or Always enabled trigger source is selected in transfer 
                descriptor Trigger source type item. This method can be also used together with Disable method to temporary 
                switch On/Off the DMA channel HW requests. In such case DMA channel registers are not reinitialized again. New 
                initialization of DMA channel can be done via SetChannelDescriptorUpdate method which reinitializes whole 
                channel with new transfer descriptor.

                structure.   If the <Enable in init. code> is set to "yes" then the device is also enabled (see the description 
                of the Enable method).  This method can be called only once. Before the second call of Init the Deinit method 
                must be called first.
   - DMA1_Deinit -Deinitializes the associated peripheral(s) and frees the component internal data structure.
   - DMA1_AllocateChannel -The method allocates DMA channel for the DMA transfer defined by the transfer descriptor input 
                parameter DescriptorPtr. This method must be called before DMA channel is initialized. Otherwise ERR_NOTAVAIL 
                error code is returned after call of DMA_LDD channel methods.
   - DMA1_EnableChannel -The method initializes and/or enables the DMA channel allocated for the DMA transfer defined by the 
                transfer descriptor input parameter DescriptorPtr. First call of this method on given DMA channel initializes 
                it and enables HW requests if Peripheral device or Always enabled trigger source is selected in transfer 
                descriptor Trigger source type item. This method can be also used together with Disable method to temporary 
                switch On/Off the DMA channel HW requests. In such case DMA channel registers are not reinitialized again. New 
                initialization of DMA channel can be done via SetChannelDescriptorUpdate method which reinitializes whole 
                channel with new transfer descriptor. After calling of EnableChannel method channel status is set to

                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.

                defined and the receiver property is enabled.

                property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.
